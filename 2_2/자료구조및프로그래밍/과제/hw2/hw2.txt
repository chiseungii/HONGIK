1. This version of address book uses structure.

2. Modify addr2.c so that it allows a new command ‘T’ or ‘t’ that calls sort_list(), which sorts the addresses according to the names.

3. Modify backend2.c and implement functions search_index(), delete() and sort_list().

4. The function sort_list() uses the standard library function qsort().

5. Duplicate names are allowed. The function delete(<name>) deletes the first record that matches <name>.

6. Submit the modified “addr2.c” and “backend2.c”.
