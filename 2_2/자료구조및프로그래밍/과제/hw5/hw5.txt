1. Implement add(), search() and delete(), and submit “backend5.c”. DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING ELSE.

2. For this assignment, implement the usual address book using hashing with chaining. Note that we do not have “P” (print) command now. (Think about why.)

3. For simplicity, we allow duplicate names, and add() puts the newly-created node in front of the linked list.

4. The functions search() and delete() prints out the number of key comparisons made to perform the operations.
Note that they do even if the operations were not successful. (Why?)
